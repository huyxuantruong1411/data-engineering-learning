The group was active in mainland China, Hong-Long, Macau, Taiwan and Japan.  The name of the circle is derived from the second opening of the *Rozen Maiden* anime, and the first works it produced were themselves related to *Rozen Maiden*.  *Touhou Project* entered the circle's focus in 2009, which is also around when they decided to increase their participation into the Japanese doujin scene.  They also sold doujins on behalf of other circles.

Based on multiple pieces of evidence, people determined that the protagonist of the series likely committed war crimes during World War II (only to then get to enjoy a second life in another world after dying unpunished). Additionally, they surfaced several past tweets from Mine from 2013 to 2015 that contained insulting and racist statements about China and South Korea.  Mine [apologized on Twitter](https://web.archive.org/web/20180605220213/https://twitter.com/mine_time2010/status/1003939970925486080), deleted all of his tweets, removed his work from Narou (including his other, *Broke Mercenary* series), and said that he would talk with his publisher about revising the printed books.  The following day, after multiple voice actors resigned from the project, the *Second Life in Another World* anime was cancelled, as later was its light novel series, tho its manga was only put on hiatus, a hiatus it would return from months later to continue for a few years more.  As for *The Strange Adventure of a Broke Mercenary*, its light novel series was also later cancelled, its Volume 16 never to be released. However, its manga remains ongoing.  **Additional Links:** - [Former Twitter Account](https://twitter.com/mine_time2010)"

He first achieved mainstream recognition for his highly successful manga series Dr. Slump, before going on to create Dragon Ball his best-known work and acting as a character designer for several popular video games such as the Dragon Quest series, Chrono Trigger and Blue Dragon. Toriyama is regarded as one of the artists that changed the history of manga, as his works are highly influential and popular, particularly Dragon Ball, which many manga artists cite as a source of inspiration.  He earned the 1981 Shogakukan Manga Award for best shounen or shoujo manga with Dr. Slump, and it went on to sell over 35 million copies in Japan. It was adapted into a successful anime series, with a second anime created in 1997, 13 years after the manga ended. His next series, Dragon Ball, would become one of the most popular and successful manga in the world. Having sold 250 300 million copies worldwide, it is the third best-selling manga of all time and is considered to be one of the main reasons for the period when manga circulation was at its highest in the mid-1980s and mid-1990s. Overseas, Dragon Ball's anime adaptations have been more successful than the manga and are credited with boosting anime's popularity in the Western world. In 2019, Toriyama was decorated a Chevalier of the French Ordre des Arts et des Lettres for his contributions to the arts."

The turning point in his life was an illness for which he was bedridden, during which time he taught himself a different way to draw [citation needed]. Katsura entered the manga industry in his second or third year of high school, when he entered a work for the Tezuka Award to win the prize money. However, he says he did not grow up reading manga, instead he read novels and watched movies.  [Video Girl Ai](https://mangadex.org/title/6d93d9dd-f303-4caa-b314-f4d817076891/video-girl-ai) was made into an original video animation and has been released in North America. A live-action movie was also made of the story. The main action of the five-volume series [DNA ](https://mangadex.org/title/032c989c-1051-4891-bf91-05de7e54b360/dna) was made into an anime television show that did not sell well enough to finish, so the story was concluded with a short OVA, which was also released in North America. [I""""s](https://mangadex.org/title/0b7c7d71-b9dc-40c7-a6b9-c74270e3dd57/i-s) was made into at least two OVAs: one two-episode side story, and one six-episode summary of the manga.  Katsura also performed as a vocalist on the songs  Tomorrow Will Be Tomorrow  and  Unseen Dream  from the two soundtracks for the *Video Girl Ai* OVA.  In 2008, he collaborated with [Akira Toriyama](https://mangadex.org/author/7bb20b16-0f35-4510-b2b3-bbeffba54c23/toriyama-akira), his good friend and creator of [Dragon Ball](https://mangadex.org/title/40bc649f-7b49-4645-859e-6cd94136e722/dragon-ball) and [Dr. Slump](https://mangadex.org/title/985e4ae6-7a36-42c5-ae12-f4291c58798c/dr-slump), for the Jump SQ one-shot [Sachie-chan Good!!](https://mangadex.org/title/0672840e-58b7-434e-9393-13dec3864913/sachie-chan-guu). The two became friends in the early 1980s, having been introduced by their mutual editor Kazuhiko Torishima, and have even parodied each other in their own manga. Toriyama credits Katsura with coming up with the idea to have two characters  fuse  together in *Dragon Ball*, leading to the famous fusion technique. However, Katsura says this is only a rumor; while he did in fact suggest it to him, he knows that Toriyama was not listening and later thought it up on his own. They worked together again in 2009, for the three-chapter one-shot [Jiya](https://mangadex.org/title/ba4e50be-4e54-435d-8908-8b65f3db4cfa/jiya) in Weekly Young Jump. These 2 series were published together in a single volume.  Also in 2008, Katsura did a design illustration of the Batman costume for Bandai's Movie Realization action figure line, basing it on the costume used in the film *The Dark Knight*."

He has won several awards, including the Shogakukan Manga Award, the Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize and Eisner Award.  Matsumoto originally wanted to be a soccer player, but changed to artist as an occupation instead. After his initial success in the Comic Open contest, he began touring France in 1986, an event that became a significant point in his career. The manga he produced covers a variety of topics, from sports to family comedies to science fiction epics.  In 1993, he began work on the [Tekkonkinkreet](https://mangadex.org/title/7661932f-7f80-4c3a-bb37-6861a1477876/tekkon-kinkreet) manga, which became a success in the Big Spirits magazine, and published a series of short stories in a collection called Nihon no Kyodai that was publicized at the time by Comic Ar  magazine. [Ping Pong](https://mangadex.org/title/7e435a27-b4fc-417d-94de-30cea79ab6f4/ping-pong) appeared in Big Spirits in 1996, soon followed by the series No. 5 in Shogakukan's Monthly Ikki magazine in 2000.  The Tekkonkinkreet anime was released in Japan in late 2006, and both the anime and manga have been published in English."

One of the pioneers of the *gekiga* genre, he was well-known for his social critique and realistic drawing style. He debuted as a mangaka in 1957, and began publishing his first popular and long-running series *Ninja Bugeichou* in 1959.   In 1964, he helped Katsuchi Nagai found the manga anthology magazine *Garo*; the first story published in the magazine was his series *Kamui*, which is often considered his most important and influential work. Deeply influenced by marxism, the series touches upon the inherent discriminations that can be found in a feudal society and is a denounciation of the treatment of the *burakumin*, a Japanese social minority.  *Kamui* ran until 1971, and was then restarted in 1988 in the magazine *Big Comic*, for which Sanpei had worked in the meantime.  Shirato Sanpei passed away on October 8th, 2021 due to aspiration pneumonia. His brother, Okamoto Tetsuji, who had worked with him as his assistant, passed away four days later of interstitial pneumonia."

His birth name is      , which is pronounced the same as       . He was born in Rehe, Manchuria, the son of a Japanese military police officer. After World War II, he grew up in Niigata Prefecture and Nara Prefecture. At 19, he moved to Tokyo. While working at a chemical factory, he drew a lot of manga and lived at Tokiwa-so, which is famous for housing many prominent mangaka.  He started his career as a sh jo artist, but in 1958, his manga Nama-chan (     ) became a hit, so he became a specialist in comedic manga. He won the Shogakukan Manga Award in 1964 for [Osomatsu-kun](https://mangadex.org/title/f51761b7-7fb6-49bf-9ec3-36fa579120ea/osomatsu-kun) and the Bungeishunj  Manga Award in 1971 for [Tensai Bakabon](https://mangadex.org/title/3b9932cf-2b6b-4b1c-8b19-ae46f2ad860b/the-genius-bakabon). Many of his manga feature supporting characters who ended up becoming more popular and more associated with their series than the main character, such as Papa (Tensai Bakabon), Iyami, Chibita (Osomatsu-kun), and Nyarome (M retsu Atar ). He is said to have been influenced by Buster Keaton and MAD magazine. In 1965, Akatsuka established his own company, """"Fujio Productions Ltd."""".

"e0be554d-476e-49dd-a04a-81fbb3e189c8","en","**Name In Native Language:**      [Kitou Mohiro]  Born in Nagoya, Aichi Prefecture, Japan, he started drawing manga when he was in elementary school and was influenced by Ozawa Satoru, Matsumoto Leiji and Kaizuka Hiroshi. He graduated from Nagoya Institute of Technology. He released several hentai works on COMIC Penguin Club while working at a local automobile manufacturer. He went to Tokyo and became an assistant to Kikuchi Shouta. Kitoh created the mangas *Shadow Star* and *Bokurano: Ours*, both of which were adapted into anime series.  Kitoh's art and writing approaches are unique, with an instantly identifiable visual style and storylines that almost always lean towards the tragic spectrum and focus primarily on the vulnerability and cruelty of human beings. A recurring element throughout his works are graphic depictions of violence and sex involving children. However, his work is not categorized as lolicon and shotacon.  Characters he draws are almost always tall, skinny, and gangly for their ages and genders. His females, unlike those of most manga series, generally have small breasts and narrow hips. His males are rarely muscular, except under a few circumstances, usually extreme close-ups. Facial features are, usually, small and expressions subtle. Nudity is common in his works."

"31fd0195-a280-435c-a190-0957d7ba8ed8","en","Made his debut in Garo in 1971 with a story called """"Kan no Mushi"""" [Irascible], about a incorrigibly bad boy whose mother takes him to a sadistic accupuncturist for a """"cure"""".  Kazuichi Hanawa is one of Japan's most revered and imitated mangaka. His macabre, erotic tales of medieval aristocracy are, in their cruely humorous depictions of late Heian-period decadence, reminiscent of the early fiction of Jun'ichiro Tanizaki. Hanawa was born April 17, 1947. He debuted as a mangaka in Garo's July 1971 issue, and his work was an instant sensation. After the death of his mother in the early eighties, Hanawa quit drawing manga and retired to his hometown in rural Saitama. There, he lived the life of a farmer while reading works on Buddhism, yoga, and psychology. He was lured back to manga in 1984 by the legendary editor Hiroshi Yaku to contribute a thirty-four page story for the debut issue of Comic Baku. Yaku remembers Hanawa at that time as a nervous man, whose morbid fear of meeting people bordered on paranoia. """"If people around here knew I was a mangaka"""", he told Yaku, """"they'd come and throw stones at me."""" Hanawa begins a manga without any preconceived plan as to the direction his story will take. He draws image upon image, holding the theme and plot together with only his enourmous powers of concentration. He has published many collections of his work and has collaborated with Suehiro Maruo on a book of illustrations titled Muzane (Cruel Pictures). Hanwa, while living in Sapporo in Northern Japan, was raided by the police over his collection of antique weaponry. He was convicted to three years of prison (Japan has very strict gun-control law enforcement). After his release, he published the work """"In the prison"""", that he drew during his imprisonment.  Lives in Sapporo (Hokkaidou) now."

He has also done work related to American comics, such as Iron Man and Hellboy (one of his illustrations was used for an official statuette of Hellboy). He also made additional contributions to old issues of Nintendo Power. In Japan, he is probably best known for the Tantei Jing ji Sabur  mystery-adventure video game series.  Terada has defined himself as a """"rakugaki"""" artist, more of a philosophy than a style of drawing, in which one draws a little everywhere, all the time, without thinking too much, on notebooks etc. He is a very prolific artist; one of his collections of sketches numbers more than 1000 pages, appropriately called Rakuga King.  He has done very little group-drawn work (an exception being the manga Saiyukiden Daienou (Monkey King)), his principal activities being illustration and character design.  His use of CG tools is integrated very well in his illustrations, giving his work a vivid and rich appearance. Most distinctive, though, are the female faces in his work, which could be described as  cute , but with a dangerous or elusive character to the eyes. He has admitted various influences on his work, particularly European ones, like Jean Giraud (a.k.a. Moebius) and the magazine M tal Hurlant which he has said gave him a taste for strong women who are slightly stripped. Won the Seiun Award for Best Artist in 2002."

Passionn e de dessin depuis l'enfance, elle int gre la section manga de l' cole de design d'Osaka. C'est pendant cette p riode estudiantine que son destin bascule, avec deux d couvertes majeures qui l'influenceront pour le reste de sa carri re...  En premier lieu Akira, le chef-d' uvre manga de Katsuhiro  tomo. Le sens du d tail et de la mise en sc ne ainsi que l'ampleur du sc nario l' merveillent. Alors, quand l'un de ses camarades lui ass ne qu'""""une fille ne pourrait jamais dessiner comme  a', loin de se laisser abattre, elle redouble d'efforts pour se rapprocher de sa nouvelle idole. La seconde r v lation advient pendant un voyage d' tudes au festival d'Angoul me. L , elle d couvre la bande dessin e europ enne dans toute sa splendeur et sa diversit ,   travers Blacksad d'abord, puis avec les grands noms du milieu, comme Moebius ou Enki Bilal.  Le style """"BD' n'est pas ce qu'il y a de plus recherch  par les  diteurs japonais, mais rien ne la fait d vier de son chemin. Quand elle trouve le site de webcomics et de vid os lanc  par Kei Fujii, elle le contacte, emball e par son initiative. Lors de leur premi re rencontre, Cocoro Hirai transmet sa passion pour la BD europ enne   Kei Fujii, qui l' coute avec int r t. C'est le d but d'une longue coop ration, lui au sc nario, elle au story-board et au dessin. Avec Sous un ciel nouveau, en 2007, c'est la cons cration. Le premier chapitre mis en ligne rassemble plus d'un million de vues en quatre jours, et l'histoire compl te se voit gratifi e d'une nomination au c l bre prix du Japan Media Arts Festival en 2017."

In addition to his very popular pilot comics, Shintani has successfully ventured into science fiction, fantasy, comedy, and hentai comics as well. In 1985, he was awarded the Shogakukan Manga Award for sh nen for Area 88 and Futari Daka.  He was an assistant to [Shinohara Tooru](https://mangadex.org/author/3221c004-d111-4481-a46b-8248dd157bb3/shinohara-tooru) during his high school years. Shintani began his career in 1972 as a shoujo artist and was nominated for the Ribon Comics Award for best new artist of that year. After working as an assistant to [Leiji Matsumoto](https://mangadex.org/author/be228b76-d5cf-46ff-9b64-38c1a012574d/matsumoto-leiji), the writer and artist of Captain Harlock and Space Battleship Yamato, Shintani began to publish aviator titles in various comic magazines. Serialization of Area 88 began in 1979 and the title has been popular ever since.  While working as an assistant to Matsumoto, one of Shintani's duties was to construct plastic models for drawing reference. Matsumoto often states that he based the character Yattaran (who appears as a supporting character in several Harlock stories) on Shintani.  He is married to [Saeki Kayono](https://mangadex.org/author/2dbc654d-3f61-4bd5-9c1e-76d318aa28bb/saeki-kayono) and sometimes provides illustrations for her manga.

Aiming for serialization, she then published *Monjushirou Kyoudai* in Jump Next!! 2014 Vol. 2. This was followed by *Rokkotsu-san* in Weekly Shounen Jump 2014 No. 39 as a part of the 9th Golden Future Cup. Again aiming for serialization, she published *Haeniwa no Zigzag* in Weekly Shounen Jump 2015 No. 21. After this and another oneshot, *Dontsuu Kazaguruma*, also failed to be serialized, editor Katayama Tatsuhiko advised her to  return to the starting point . Reworking *Kagarigari*, 3 storyboard chapters of *Kisatsu no Nagare* were created. These storyboards were then further worked into Gotouge's first serialization, *Kimetsu no Yaiba*, in 2016."

In the 70s he became a freelancer and worked on TV anime. Some of his most famous work as a character designer or director are """"Space Battleship Yamato"""", """"Brave Raideen"""", """"Combattler V"""" and """"Mobile Suit Gundam"""".  In 1979, he made his debut as a mangaka with """"Arion"""" serialized in the newly founded magazine """"Ryu"""". Following this, Yasuhiko alternated between the Anime and Manga worlds with works like """"Kiba - The Legend of White Fang"""", """"Crusher Joe"""", and """"Giant Gorg"""", and """"Star of the Kurds"""", """"C-Court"""", and """"Venus Wars"""".  These worlds would overlap, when his manga """"Arion"""" would get adapted into an anime film in 1986 with the title """"Neo Heroic Fantasia: Arion"""". Following this, he would adapt his SF Military Chronicle """"Venus Wars"""" into an anime film in 1989. The anime film adaptation for """"Venus Wars"""" came at an unfortunate point for Yasuhiko, and the film was sealed, preventing it from being made readily available on home video formats in Japan (though still made accessible overseas). He turned to manga completely and had gained a respectable reputation as a history mangaka with works focusing on both Japanese history with """"Jinmu"""", """"Namuji"""", """"Yamato Takeru"""" and European history with """"Alexandros"""", """"Joan"""", and Theology with """"Jesus"""".  In 2001 he adapted the First Gundam anime into a manga with """"Mobile Suit Gundam: The Origin"""" and was colossally popular, being serialized for 24 Tankoban volumes.  With over 50 years worth of experience across multiple mediums of entertainment and showing no signs of stopping, Yasuhiko's terrific worldview continues to touch the hearts of many around the world.  In 1981 he won the Seiun Award in the Art category. In 1992 he won the Japan Cartoonists Association Award for his work """"Namuji""""."

"3510d7c1-4252-409e-aefb-b1e1ab27368c","en","**Name In Native Language:**       Born Takahashi Kazuo (    ) in Tokyo on October 4, 1961, for much of his childhood he was a fan of manga and anime such as Tiger Mask, Ultraman, Mazinger Z, and Devilman. In his youth his teacher called him  the poop machine that knows nothing except eating, sleeping and pooping , which insulted him so much that he decided to become a mangaka in retaliation. He started submitting manga to Shogakukan under the pen name Hajime Miyabi in 1981 and to Kodansha using his real name in 1986, but suffering from extreme poverty he decided to try his hand at Shueisha instead. Inspired by the D Arby battles in Jojo s Bizarre Adventure, he started writing the gaming manga Yu-Gi-Oh in 1996, which quickly ballooned into a massively popular franchise and one of the most popular trading card games in the world.   After completing Yu-Gi-Oh in 2004, in lieu of resting on his laurels, Takahashi-sensei continued to work behind the scenes. Acting as supervisor for the Yu-Gi-Oh franchise, he provided ideas and character designs for its sequel series such as Yu-Gi-Oh GX and Yu-Gi-Oh 5D s, as well as monitoring their manga adaptations. He was no slouch on his own, either - he made a short series The Comiq in Weekly Shonen Jump in 2018, and in 2019 he partnered with Marvel to release Secret Reverse on Jump+, a short series about Spider-Man and Iron Man fighting a game-loving supervillain. In fact, Takahashi-sensei loved American comics - Hellboy was his favorite, and its author Mike Mignola even did a collaboration with Takahashi-sensei.   On July 4, 2022, Takahashi-sensei drowned off the coast of Okinawa while snorkeling (apparently a favorite pastime of his). According to eyewitnesses, he was assisting in the rescue of three others who were caught in a rip current."

"5863578d-4e4f-4b57-b64d-1dd45a893cb0","en","**Name In Native Language:**        Miura Kentarou (July 11, 1966   May 6, 2021) was born in Chiba City, Chiba Prefecture, Japan. He was left-handed. In 1976, at the early age of 10, Miura made his first manga, titled Miuranger, which was published for his classmates in a school publication; the manga ended up spanning 40 volumes. In 1977, Miura created his second manga titled Ken e No Michi (The Way to the Sword), using Indian ink for the first time.   In 1988, Miura bounced back with a 48-page manga known as Berserk Prototype, as an introduction to the current Berserk fantasy world.  In 1989, as a collaboration with writer [Buronson](https://mangadex.org/author/9be55a5a-2512-447b-9847-16169e44aeaf) and illustrated by Miura, Ourou was published in the Monthly Animal House magazine. In the following year, a sequel titled Ourouden was published in the same magazine. In the same year 1989, the 6th issue of the Monthly Animal House, the first issue of the solo project Berserk was released with relatively limited success. Miura again collaborated with Buronson on a manga titled Japan that was published in Young Animal from the 1st issue to the 8th of 1992, and was later released as a stand-alone tankoubon. Miura's fame grew after Berserk was serialized in Young Animal in 1992 with the release of """"The Golden Age"""" story arc of Berserk, and the huge success of his masterpiece made him one of the most prominent contemporary mangaka. At this time, Miura dedicated himself solely to work on Berserk. He indicated, however, that he intended to publish more manga in the future.  Miura provided the designs for the Vocaloid Kamui Gakupo, whose voice is taken from the Japanese singer and actor, Gackt.  Miura Kentarou died on May 6, 2021 due to an acute aortic dissection at 54 years old."

He has been drawing manga since he was four years old, and for most of his professional career has created two series simultaneously. The stories to many of these were co-written in collaboration with his former editor, Takashi Nagasaki. Urasawa has been called one of the artists that changed the history of manga and has won numerous awards, including the Shogakukan Manga Award three times, the Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize twice, and the Kodansha Manga Award once. By 2016, his various works had over 126 million copies in circulation.  His early style was inspirational and warm youth growth manga, and then turned to a deep discussion of human nature and social phenomena, covering topics such as history, psychology, criminology and science fiction. He was a 1960s and 1970s rock fan. It's influence can be strongly reflected in the *20th Century Boys*. He likes Bob Dylan very much."

"f98da9cc-0774-4e0e-924c-eb78ae735558","en","I am a Lithuanian creator who started his path in art as a teenager drawing daily, then turned to architecture in my study years. However, after graduating I decided to follow my passion for comics and debuted with my one shot  Broken Watch  in Summer of Manga 2021. I love Japanese manga ranging from serious seinen to heartwarming slice-of-life stories. The desire to capture not only action but also emotions of the characters, as well as cinematographic backgrounds is what describes my art. I like listening to music, playing drums, skateboarding, and binging manga series in my free time.

"c0e8dbc7-dfc4-4957-babb-00e4702c8286","en","**Alt names**:       --- During his formative years in university as a student of optical science, Tsuruta, who had initially wanted to be a photographer, had been inspired by the works of numerous science fiction authors, such as Robert A. Heinlein, and manga artists, such as [Hoshino Yukinobu](https://mangadex.org/author/706826f2-20a1-413f-a874-706f1b1f64f0) and his manga [Saber Tiger](https://mangadex.org/title/af8a97fb-3098-4833-90b3-7fceffe231d1), which had inspired him to create manga. He has also cited [Chiba Tetsuya](https://mangadex.org/author/bb386677-86cf-43ee-bc3d-28f3bb4bdf4e) and his manga among his inspirations.  Soon after graduating, he wrote numerous doujinshi and was an assistant to numerous manga artists, prior to making his debut as a professional manga artist. In 1986, Tsuruta made his professional debut, authoring his first manga series, the short work, *Hirokute Suteki na Uchuu janai ka?* (              ?, a.k.a. What a Big Wonderful Universe It Is), which was serialized in Kodansha's Weekly Morning seinen magazine, set in a world where the land was sinking into water. Tsuruta has cited that the inspiration to this debut work of his came during a train journey from Tokyo to the ocean at Odawara, during which he had seen numerous rice paddies and thought of the possibility of a train line passing through the ocean, after which he wanted to create a work where he could use this image.  Soon after, Tsuruta authored [Spirit of Wonder](https://mangadex.org/title/39187992-cd1f-4095-9f25-cc532b938393), among his most famous works, in which he applied many of his inspirations, which was serialized in Kodansha's seinen magazines Weekly Morning and Afternoon between 1987 and 1996, and was later adapted into an anime series.  After Spirit of Wonder, Tsuruta wrote short manga works, and also illustrated numerous art books, which were quite successful. In 2002, he provided the character designs for the anime series Abenobashi Mah  Sh tengai and also authored its manga adaptation.  In 2000, 2001 and 2013, Tsuruta received the 31st, 32nd and 44th Seiun Awards for outstanding artist of the year. He has also received the Hayakawa Award for best illustrator, in 2000."

His best-selling work, *Fairy Tail*, published in the same magazine from 2006 to 2017, became one of the best-selling manga series ever with over 72 million copies in print. Mashima began the currently ongoing *EDENS ZERO* in 2018.  Mashima is known for many things, but his big three tend to be an artstyle reminiscent of *One Piece*, a love for the power of friendship, and a strong work ethic - at one point, he wrote six chapters of *Fairy Tail* in two weeks, and even recently simultaneously balanced drawing *EDENS ZERO*, doing storyboards for *Fairy Tail* spinoffs, and playing video games in his spare time."

Originally working in the video game industry, writing and illustrating for such titles as Zero4 Champ and Little Busters Q, Hasemi later pivoted into writing scripts for anime like Moetan and Powerpuff Girls Z. Notably, he wrote a third of the episodes of Black Cat s anime adaptation, which had him work with Black Cat s creator Kentaro Yabuki.

"90cbcd59-8597-4504-b4d0-97c9fd086385","en","Ryou Kurashina is a Japanese former comic artist and author who dropped out of Meiji University. Maakou and Jibiki Kazuya were once his assistants.  He specializes in stories about Mizu shoubai, euphemism for the night-time entertainment business (or, as he calls it, """"Neon-gai mono""""). He is a big name in this field, and is said to be the founder of Neon Gekiga. He used to write gekiga under the name Tsukasa Kei (also written original manga under the name """"Takashi Tsukasa""""). In addition to writing original manga, he also runs the editorial production companies """"Free Hand"""" and """"Office Kei"""" under his real name, Keiji Ooba, and is contracted by publishers to produce entire magazines or parts of them.  In 1971, he made his debut as a manga artist under the name """"Takashi Tsukasa"""". He worked mainly for youth magazines, and produced a number of hit works, mainly bunkara stories, and has created many long-selling works,(representative works include """"Yabou no Mure,"""" """"Aizu Otoko Uta,"""" """"Takeda Miken Hoshi,"""" and """"Shouwa Baka Hayashi""""). In particular, """"Yabou no Mure"""" is famous as a super-long hit that ran for 28 volumes. More than 40 of his works have been published in tankobon form.  However, he gradually began to feel stalled as a comic book author, and decided to abandon writing. As a result, he changed his name to Ryo Kurashina and restarted his career as a full-time cartoonist. His first original work was the """"Akujo no Kagami"""" series with Issaku Wake. Many of his original works are Neon Gekiga with female protagonists, and his representative works include """"Jotei"""", """"Jouou,"""" and """"Yaou"""", which were made into TV dramas. He also writes not only neon stories but also economic stories such as """"DAWN"""" and """"Zenibana"""", maiko stories such as """"Jotei Hanamai"""" and """"Hanna rito"""", and entertainment stories such as """"Joyuu"""" and """"Ai Ningyo""""."

"d8f7b98b-c60a-447e-ba84-aa1f4adb4090","en","Maruo dropped out of senior high school in 1973 and worked in Tokyo for a bookbinder.  He is a self-taught artist whose works are characterized by a an extreme graphic violence and a mortifying vision of sex, many of his stories are permeated by a general surrealism.  Suehiro Maruo was born into a poor family on January 28, 1956, the youngest of seven brothers and sisters. An intensely private child, he claims not to have spoken more than a few words to his parents during the entire youth. He drew all the time as a boy and especially enjoyed tracing the popular action manga """"Eightman."""" At age thirteen, Maruo began regularly skipping school in order to catch the daily showing of the popular soap opera, """"Hyoten."""" He dropped out of school after junior high and was living on his own by the age of fifteen. His troubled ways proliferated, as he began shoplifting - at first, art books, and eventually almost anything. This behavior culminated in a two-week jail stay in the mid-seventies when he was caught stealing Pink Floyd and Santana albums from a local record shop. Maruo began drawing manga seriously at age nineteen. He brought his initial efforts to Garo, but was perfunctorily rejected. At twenty-four he debuted as a mangaka in the pages of a porn magazine, the title of which he has since forgotten. Maruo describes his mature manga as a """"collection of thefts"""" (Kazuichi Hanawa was a major influence), and he admits to lifting the idea for """"Planet of the Jap"""" from Philip K. Dick's sci-fi classic, The Man in the High Castle. Unlike many of the underground mangaka, Maruo is a supremely accomplished draftsman in the traditional mold, and he has gone out of his way to disassociate himself from the more self-consciously idiosyncratic aspects of Garo. He says that publishers think his works attracts the same audience as that of underground great, Yoshiharu Tsuge, but that in reality his biggest fans are high-school girls. He even progresses a deep hatred for all modern art.  Because of this his works didn't fit the mass-market magazines and he had to wait until the 1980 for making his official debut as manga artist.  He also has published short stories on the """"alternative"""" magazine Garo. The french critique Thierry Groensteen has defined him as """"Marquis de Sade of the manga"""".  But Maruo is not just another """"sex and violence"""" manga artist - he is one of the greatest retro-artists working in the manga field today. His drawings are elegant, and he uses innovative page designs. Today, Maruo's art and stories go far beyond the readers of Ero-manga; his work is sold in deluxe hardback book format, and limited editions of his lithographed prints sell for high prices.  He has realized that his work is most powerful and lyrical when he refrains from sex and violence, and so today he is working on a new series for the mainstream manga magazine Young Champion. Maruo's most famous works are 'Planet of the Jap' and 'Mr. Arachi's Amazing Freak Show'."

After graduating from Gunma Prefectural Maebashi Commercial High School in 1969, Adachi worked as an assistant for Isami Ishii. He made his manga debut in 1970 with Kieta Bakuon, based on a manga originally created by Satoru Ozawa. Kieta was published in Deluxe Sh nen Sunday (a manga magazine published by Shogakukan) .  Mitsuru Adachi is well known for romantic comedy and sports manga (especially baseball) such as Touch, H2, Slow Step, Miyuki and Cross Game. He has been described as a writer of """"delightful dialogue"""", a genius at portraying everyday life, """"the greatest pure storyteller"""", and """"a master manga artist"""". He is one of the few manga artists to write for sh nen, sh jo and seinen manga magazines, and be popular in all three.  Mitsuru is the youngest in the family, with two older brothers and one older sister. The second brother, [Adachi Tsutomu](https://mangadex.org/author/23fc6623-0e50-411a-a80b-5a8c01b3340a/adachi-tsutomu), was once the assistant of [Akatsuka Fujio](https://mangadex.org/author/609ce7f0-4f06-4074-90c3-5bd714f09e57/fujio-akatsuka), and Mitsuru was also affected in manga because of this, and his first work was also found with the help of his brother. However, after Mitsuru became famous, his brother's work still did not improve, and finally died of illness. Therefore, Mitsuru respected his second brother Tsutomu very much, and often depicted the image of friendly brothers in his manga."

The story was then serialized in Weekly Shounen Jump beginning on February 20, 2012, and ending on July 20, 2020. The series was awarded the 61st Shougakukan Manga Award in the Shounen category and ranked in the top three manga series for the 2015 Sugoi Japan Award. In 2020, the series was in the top five best selling manga in Japan, with over seven million copies sold. The series has also received numerous adaptations, notably an anime television series and a stage play.  In an early stage of *Haikyuu!!*'s serialization, in order not to make readers feel bored, Furudate tried various storyboards, but a neighbor thought it was difficult to understand; later, Furudate saw a passenger on the train reading """"JUMP"""" and skip *Haikyuu!!*. Furudate was deeply affected, so he made up his mind to improve his storyboard and painting style to make it more concise and easy to understand."

"afa6b8e8-0682-4a2b-86b9-803d51690498","en","From Wikipedia:  Clive Staples Lewis, FBA (29 November 1898   22 November 1963) was a British writer and Anglican lay theologian. He held academic positions in English literature at both Oxford University (Magdalen College, 1925 1954) and Cambridge University (Magdalene College, 1954 1963). He is best known as the author of The Chronicles of Narnia, but he is also noted for his other works of fiction, such as The Screwtape Letters and The Space Trilogy, and for his non-fiction Christian apologetics, including Mere Christianity, Miracles, and The Problem of Pain.  Lewis was a close friend of J. R. R. Tolkien, author of The Lord of the Rings. Both men served on the English faculty at Oxford University and were active in the informal Oxford literary group known as the Inklings. According to Lewis's 1955 memoir Surprised by Joy, he was baptized in the Church of Ireland but fell away from his faith during adolescence. Lewis returned to Anglicanism at the age of 32, owing to the influence of Tolkien and other friends, and he became an """"ordinary layman of the Church of England"""". Lewis's faith profoundly affected his work, and his wartime radio broadcasts on the subject of Christianity brought him wide acclaim.  Lewis wrote more than 30 books which have been translated into more than 30 languages and have sold millions of copies. The books that make up The Chronicles of Narnia have sold the most and have been popularized on stage, TV, radio, and cinema. His philosophical writings are widely cited by Christian scholars from many denominations."

He is best known for his manga series Sket Dance, which was serialized in Weekly Sh nen Jump from 2007 to 2013 and won the Shogakukan Manga Award in 2010.  Shinohara was born on 9 January 1974, in Chiba Prefecture. Starting his career as a salaryman, Shinohara decided to drop out of his white-collar job for two years while preparing for his debut as a manga artist.  Shinohara worked as an assistant under Hideaki Sorachi on Gintama for a short time using the alias Shintaroh Nakae (         , Nakae Shintar ), an anagram of """"Kenta Shinohara"""". During his stint with Sorachi, Shinohara called him a """"teacher"""" who taught him necessary skills.  In both June and September 2003, Shinohara was a finalist for the monthly JUMP 12 Outstanding Rookie Manga Award (            ), though he did not win either awards.  Shinohara wrote two one-shots for Sket Dance in the winter and summer of 2006, submitting them to Akamaru Jump and Weekly Sh nen Jump respectively. The second one-shot was a pilot arranged in a book volume format, similar to the eventual first chapter of the main series. Serialization of Sket Dance began on 14 July 2007 in Weekly Sh nen Jump.  In the fifteenth volume of Sket Dance, released on 1 September 2010, Shinohara announced that he would be getting married. He is the brother-in-law of fellow manga artist [Kentaro Yabuki](https://mangadex.org/author/a36f5f24-d009-46b5-bee3-b0ceb6a52067)."

"6952e051-f903-477f-a26a-0357e118d7fc","en","Japanese illustrator and sh jo manga artist. Matsumoto's 16-page The Mysterious Clover is recognized as a pioneering work in the field of manga, but he is best known for his sh jo manga Kurukuru Kurumi-chan.  His illustrations were popular from the 1930s through the 1950s, and he contributed illustrations to numerous popular girls' novels by some of the period's most famous authors, including Yasunari Kawabata and Nobuko Yoshiya. He was also a prolific illustrator of children's books and created merchandise for babies, small children, and girls. The Gallery Katsuji Matsumoto in Tokyo is managed by his surviving children.  Matsumoto was born on July 25, 1904, in Kobe, the son of Toraji and Ishi Matsumoto. He moved with his family to Tokyo at the age of eight. At the age of 13, he began attending what was then called Rikky  (St. Paul's) Middle School. Through the introduction of a teacher at Rikky , Matsumoto began drawing illustrations for the magazine Shinseinen at the age of 17. Matsumoto withdrew from Rikky  at the age of 18 and began attending the Kawabata ga gakk . During this time he contributed drawings to such magazines as Sh jo Sekai and Sh nen Sekai. It was during this period that Matsumoto was inspired by illustrator K ji Fukiya to become an illustrator in the field of girls' media. would eventually marry Fukiya. Following the devastation of Tokyo, including its publishing industry, in the 1923 Great Kant  earthquake, Matsumoto decided to try his fortunes overseas and managed to obtain free passage to Shanghai. His hope was to eventually make his way to Paris. In Shanghai, he earned money by contributing illustrations and articles to the Shanghai Daily Newspaper, but when he turned twenty years of age, he was forced to return to Japan to report for the draft. He was rejected for military service because he was flat footed.  Matsumoto's first forum for steady work was the magazine Sh jo Gah , to which he contributed from 1928 to 1938. Matsumoto first ventured into manga in Sh jo Gah , creating a series of illustrated narratives featuring a lively Chinese girl named Poku-chan, which was irregularly published between November 1930 and March 1934. The Poku-chan strips were drawn in a stylized, almost abstract, Art Deco manner. Matsumoto could draw in a wide range of styles, from the realistic to the near-abstract, but all of his work was distinguished by clean, almost geometrical lines and a strictly Modern sensibility. While he illustrated numerous dramatic girls' novels, his style was better suited to sunny, playful, or humorous work. In 1935, Matsumoto began to work for the magazine that would become his primary forum, Sh jo no Tomo. Sh jo no Tomo, with its modern, stylish image, was the ideal magazine for Matsumoto. In 1932, at the age of 28, Matsumoto was wed to Ayako Nimori. They went on to have seven children (four boys, and three girls) together. Because Ayako was an only child, the decision was made to have the firstborn male child legally adopted by her parents in order to carry on the Nimori name. On official records, therefore, Ki Nimori is listed as the younger brother of Ayako, and therefore the brother-in-law of Matsumoto."

"be228b76-d5cf-46ff-9b64-38c1a012574d","en","Associated Names: L. Matsumoto, MATSUMOTO Akira, MATSUMOTO L, MATSUMOTO Reiji,      ,        Birth Place: Kurume, Fukuoka, Japan  Birth Date: January 25, 1938 Zodiac: Aquarius Blood Type: B  The trademarks of Matsumoto are his unusual artstyle, the space opera and the manly romance stories.  Matsumoto's art might take some getting used to, but he is renowned for coming up with great stories and brilliant new concepts. Debuting in 1953 with a 16 page manga """"Mitsubachi no Bouken"""" in Manga Shounen, he has authored nearly thirty manga series. His big break came in 1971, in the years between 53 and 71 he mostly produced Shoujo manga, much to his displeasure. In the late '70s and the early '80s, there was a big Matsumoto-boom when he drew his best known series. After that, things became more quiet around him, but the late '90s show a revival. In 1997, Matsumoto began to create new adventures of Captain Harlock which can be admired on the Web in Japanese and in English.  Born on the same day as [ISHINOMORI Shotaro](https://mangadex.org/author/36f5f595-0196-4d0a-aae1-0f730679d10a/ishinomori-shotaro), and both of them at the same time were assistants under [TEZUKA Osamu](https://mangadex.org/author/21575d70-b954-4e3a-80df-00192f413a83/tezuka-osamu).  His real name is Matsumoto Akira. Reiji is a pseudonym and means something like """"Zero Warrior"""". His name is often rendered in romaji as """"Matsumoto Leiji"""". Matsumoto is married to [MAKI Miyako](https://mangadex.org/author/f0e514c6-3bd4-483a-89ce-79dbcb17045d/maki-miyako).  Leiji Matsumoto, the son of an air force pilot, was only fifteen years old when his first story,  Mitsubachi no Bouken , was published in Manga Sh nen. Soon, he created a varying oeuvre, at first inspired by Tezuka, in several genres: children's comics ( Kuroi Hanabira ,  S no Taiyou , science fiction (Denkou Ozma, Sexaroid, Kousoku Esper), westerns and others. He was one of the first mangakas whose manga and animation work crossed over internationally.  His fame came with the series Otoko Oidon, about the student Nobotta Oyama, who was rejected by all universities. Matsumoto mostly enjoyed creating war stories, but he had his biggest success with science fiction stories such as Uchuu Senkan Yamato, a series that was created simultaneously for TV and comics. His space pirate Captain Harlock first appeared in Arcadia in 1977. Around the same time, he set up other science fiction series, including Ginga Tetsudou 999 and Sennen Joou. His 1974 Sci-Fi anime  Space Cruiser Yamato  earned fame in the USA from 1979 under the title 'Star Blazers'. Matsumoto was hired by the French band Daft Punk to animate their music videos from the album  Discovery , and compiled into the 2003 anime movie 'Interstella 5555'.  Among his assistants there were [SENNO Knife](https://mangadex.org/author/c33f02c8-174e-4005-9a49-4f3cd027cac8/senno-knife), [SHINTANI Kaoru](https://mangadex.org/author/87db03ea-8f14-4404-8cfd-47fc91229f6f/shintani-kaoru), and [AKANA Shuu](https://mangadex.org/author/a12c508a-3805-4971-86fe-1bc83efd2074/akana-shuu).   *Matsumoto died of acute heart failure at a hospital in Tokyo on February 13, 2023, at 85.*  Sources:  - [MangaUpdates](https://www.mangaupdates.com/authors.html?id=2044)  - [Anilist](https://anilist.co/staff/97597/Matsumoto-Leiji)  - Ultimate Manga Guide"

She is married to fellow mangaka Tatsuneko and has a daughter. Yun began her career as a doujinshi artist creating doujinshi for works such as Saint Seiya, Captain Tsubasa and Maouden. She debuted in a commercial magazine with the original work Metal Heart (serialised in Kobunsha's Comic VAL from November 1986). After her debut, she continued to contribute on numerous doujin works. However, the later disbanding of a doujin circle, Yajou Teikoku, she had founded with Maki Chikura, led to her taking numerous breaks from her commercial works. Due to this, there were incomplete works penned by her during this period.  During her years in middle school, she had been a fan of Masami Kurumada's manga series Ring ni Kakero, Fuuma no Kojirou, Saint Seiya and B't X (serialised in Weekly Shounen Jump), sending Kurumada numerous fan letters asking to meet him, after which Kurumada finally agreed, inviting her to his workplace.  When asked about her penname in an interview in the September 2006 issue of Puff, she responded that she had originally thought of making it Kouga Jun, but subsequently changed it to Kouga Yun."

"35db24e2-3a98-4394-bd7b-66113a5bd1f0","en","Writer, screenwriter and film director        ~ Adachi Hirotaka born on October 21, 1978 in Tanushimaru (now Kurume), Fukuoka prefecture, where he will graduate from Tanushimaru's Kawakai Primary and Secondary Schools.  This multifaceted and shy artist who loves video games - with Dance Dance Revolution and a correct diet he manages to lose the 85 kilos that kept him self-conscious and a victim of school bullying to 65 kilos -. Other hobbies immerse him in the world of manga, anime and movies.  His first readings - especially mystery - induce him to write his first novel at the age of 16, fleeing what he himself describes as """"the most depressing era of his life"""", while studying and graduating simultaneously between 1994 and 1999 from the Kurume National College tries a fantasy sekai to appear for the Fujimi Prize for Novel that doesn't work. This does not discourage him and in 1996 he won the Grand Prize for Novel: the 6th JUMP Prize for Novel - not fictional - from the publisher Shueisha, thus making his debut with                  ~ Natsu, hanabi to watashi no shitai, JUMP J -BOOKS, Sueisha, illustrated by Hideaki Hataji. On that occasion Kurimoto Kaoru, judge in said contest, strongly recommended him. At 17 he is formally a career writer. Graduating from the College of Engineering, Ecological Engineering Course at Toyohashi University of Technology where he transferred.  In 2003 he received third place at the Honkaku Mistery Awards. In the early days, his attention turned to short stories and light novels - of which he becomes a staunch supporter -, becoming abundant and with unusual ideas, but GOTH        ~ Tenohira Jiken, Kadokawa Shoten, was highly rated as a mystery novel, receiving the Honkaku Mystery Award. Also, the early works were largely divided into horror novels and sad stories, which is why they were labeled Kuro Otsuichi and Shiro Otsuichi, respectively. Under the name Otsuichi, he mainly writes novels in Shueisha, Kadokawa Shoten (currently KADOKAWA), and Gentosha.  Invited by his editor to audition tests of the film Innocent (2004), by director Oshii Mamoru, he meets his daughter, Oshii Tomoe, whom he married in 2006.

Data that the author himself brings to light definitively on June 30, 2011, on Twitter, that he was active under the aliases of Yamashiro Asako and Nakata Eiichi.  In November 2012, he attended the Shogakukan Children's Publishing Culture Award presentation ceremony, in which Kuchibiru ni Uta was selected under the name Nakata Eiichi, and the Mainichi Shimbun reported on this alias. Furthermore, in 2010 he also participates in the project of a series called Makai Detective Meiousei O, in which eight writers hide their names each and write a book under the name of Echizen Mataro.  Under his real name Adachi Hirotaka produces an independent film. In 2004, he was selected for the 5th Takarazuka Film Festival and Video Contest by G suto wa sh setsuka ga suki and does four more works about 2015. In 2016, Otsuichi, Nakata Eiichi, Yamashiro Asako and Echizen Mataro publish a collection of short stories - commented by Adachi Hirotaka -, called Kill Mary Sue, thus gathering all his aliases. He also revealed that he contributed a film essay under the name Yuushi Pillow, a then-unknown alias. In May 2016 issue of the Da Vinci, he also does a talk project in the top three aliases under the title A Miraculous Talk Was Made.  His style has inspired authors such as Tomoi Hitsuji, recipient of the Kono misuter  ga sugoi! 2012 to Excellence, confessing a fan of Otsuichi. Close personal friends authors Sadakane Shinji and Matsubara Makoto after taking a trip to Turkey with the author, co-write Toruko or ryok  shi.  In 2010 became father for his first child.

He became prominent again during the 1990's-early 2000's, much due to the emergence of Lolita-as-we-know-it during the same period. MACOTO's work has been featured in several Gothic & Lolita Bibles, and Lolita everywhere treasure his lovely, albeit repetitive, glittery-eyed maidens in their flora-adorned, Fairytale worlds. In recent years he has kept a significantly lower profile, although he has his own official gallery located in Chiba. MACOTO also has an annual show in Ginza.  He died on November 17, 2024 from esophagogastric junction cancer."

He is best known for his samurai-themed series Rurouni Kenshin: Meiji Swordsman Romantic Story (1994 1999), which has over 70 million copies in circulation and a sequel he is currently creating titled Rurouni Kenshin: The Hokkaido Arc (2017 present). He has written three more series, the western *Gun Blaze West* (2001), the supernatural *Buso Renkin* (2003 2005), and the horror manga *Embalming -The Another Tale of Frankenstein-* (2007 2015). Watsuki has mentored several well-known manga artists, including One Piece creator [Eiichiro Oda](https://mangadex.org/author/b6045e2c-28f4-4ce0-b4dd-b14070f2f5ae/oda-eiichiro), [Hiroyuki Takei](https://mangadex.org/author/a3088532-5bc2-414f-b43c-8525e1b723f0/takei-hiroyuki) of Shaman King fame, and Mr. Fullswing author [Shinya Suzuki](https://mangadex.org/author/26d971d0-0a3c-46f6-977e-cde9c07808f0/suzuki-shinya).  In November 2017, police found DVDs with footage of naked girls in their early teens in Watsuki's Tokyo office. Tokyo Police raided Watsuki's home as part of an investigation into the purchase of child pornography. The search uncovered DVDs containing videos of naked girls less than 18 years of age. He was referred to prosecutors over possession of child pornography on November 21. The serialization of Rurouni Kenshin: The Hokkaido Arc was put on hiatus after the details of Watsuki's charges were made public. In February 2018, Watsuki was fined  200,000. The Hokkaido Arc resumed serialization in June 2018."

Akasegawa was also associated with the avant-garde.  In January 1963, Akasegawa sent out invitations to a solo exhibition in the form of 1,000 yen notes with information regarding the exhibit on their backs. The following year, he was indicted for creating imitations of banknotes stemming from the 1894 Law Controlling the Imitation of Currency and Securities and was eventually convicted and given a 3 months suspended sentence for what was dubbed the """"Thousand-Yen Bill Incident.""""  His satirical manga, Sakura Illustrated, was originally published in the Asahi Journal (a weekly news magazine). Editorial disputes over its content led to a recall of one issue of the magazine, and led to a complete reorganization of its editorial board, cancelling publication the magazine for the following two weeks.  He writes humorous essays and other literary works under the pen name Otsuji Katsuhiko.  Passed away on October 26, 2014."

He debuted the next year in Akamaru Jump 2007 SUMMER with *Tenko*, followed by *Boku no Hero* in Akamaru Jump 2008 WINTER and *Shinka Rhapsody* in Akamaru Jump 2008 SUMMER.  In 2010, he published the oneshot *Oumagadoki Doubutsuen* in Weekly Shounen Jump No. 2, and it was serialized that same year, running for 5 volumes.  Later in 2011, he published the oneshot *Uchuu Shounen Bulge* in Jump NEXT! 2011 SUMMER. In 2012, this would be reworked and serialized in Weekly Shounen Jump as *Sensei no Bulge*, lasting for only for 2 volumes. However, it was at this point that Horikoshi began gaining worldwide popularity, including in the USA and Europe.  In 2014, he reworked his older oneshot and serialized it as *Boku no Hero Academia*. The series quickly became a hit, growing into a franchise and winning national and international prizes.  He was an assistant of Tanaka Yasuki.  Miyokawa Masaru, Watanabe Chihiro, and Shibata Yuusaku worked as his assistants on *Oumagadoki Doubutsuen*. Horie Ryuu and Akiyama Yoco worked as his assistants on *Boku no Hero Academia*. Neda Hirofumi and Ootake Toshitomo worked as his assistants on both series.  Osada Yu-Ko is one of Horikoshi's influences, with him stating that Osada's drawings are the complete form of shounen manga.  He used to submit One Piece fanart and [a Smoker drawing of his](https://assets.st-note.com/img/1642402322661-yTsNLAGHF6.jpg) was featured in Volume 23's Usopp Gallery Pirates.  He started reading American comics after Sam Raimi's *Spider-Man* in 2002.  He has a sister."

"03e4afc4-cd94-45a0-bb36-dfd34fa370b3","en","**Hirohiko Araki** (      , born June 7, 1960) is a Japanese manga artist. He is best known for his long-running series JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, which was first published in Weekly Sh nen Jump in 1987 and has sold over 100 million copies as of 2016 in Japan alone.  Araki participated in the Junior Baseball Team in primary school and Kendo Club in middle school. He has a pair of twin younger sisters. Because he was often bullied by his sister, he would hide away to read manga. He liked manga when he was a child, so he wants to be a manga artist. His favorite works are Star of the Giants by Kajiwara Ikki , and Babel II by Yokoyama. Araki had the experience of shaking hands with Tezuka Osamu.  He likes western pop music, horror movies and Italy very much. We can see a lot of the above elements in his representative work JOJO.His painting style was influenced by Renaissance paintings, especially Michelangelo.  He gets up at 10 a.m. every day, draws a Name on Sunday, finishes the draft from Monday to Thursday, rests on Friday and Saturday, and doesn't stay up late. This work and rest lasted more than ten years . The work and rest of this law is influenced by the manga artist [Akimoto Osamu](https://mangadex.org/author/1cd79d33-68b3-4879-b67a-834055ef99eb/akimoto-osamu). Although he is over 50, his face does not show his old state. He is even joked by other manga artists and fans as """"the younger he lives"""", """"Immortality"""", """"using corrugation or stone ghost face"""", """"in fact, he is also a Stand, and his ability is that he will not grow old""""."

Even then, Ikegami had the magic touch, and his first two collaborative efforts, *I Ueo Boy* with [Koike Kazuo](https://mangadex.org/author/785c1506-618e-4829-9533-86995c04c0a4) in 1973 and *Otoko Gumi with [Kariya Tetsu](https://mangadex.org/author/4279ea10-bc91-47f9-b7a7-aca12bc4430f) in 1974, proved so popular that they set the pattern for what would turn out to be one of the manga world's biggest success stories. Although many of his earlier works were written and drawn solo, nowadays Ikegami works almost exclusively with collaborators and shows no signs of stopping.  He worked for [Mizuki Shigeru](https://mangadex.org/author/9a7709d7-c9a6-4afb-bdf9-054aec977140) as an assistant for about a year and a half.  He is a fan of [Tsuge Yoshiharu](https://mangadex.org/author/0495ec83-5f94-4b89-af30-5db3238581f1)'s works. Ikegami was surprised when he saw Tsuge also worked at Mizuki Shigeru's place.  Ikegami once applied to be an assistant to [Satou Masaaki](https://mangadex.org/author/ec701ae7-65a4-4fcc-884c-bee29d3baaac) & [Saitou Takao](https://mangadex.org/author/bc302292-841c-42b1-962d-bcb41d427ae2), but they already had enough assistants at that time.

The son of a town council member in Fuchu, Aki District, Hiroshima, Kubo graduated from the local high school and went on to Anabuki Design College in Hiroshima City but dropped out. In an interview, Kubo has stated that he entered a magazine's manga contest, and that although he did not win, one of the magazine's editors noticed his talent. They subsequently worked together on joint projects. Not long afterward, his first manga short, """"Ultra Unholy Hearted Machine"""", was published in Shueisha's Weekly Shonen Jump Special in 1996. This was followed by two more shorts, and in 1999 his first serial, Zombie Powder, began in Weekly Shonen Jump and ran for four volumes until 2000.  His next serial, Bleach, about a high school student who becomes a shinigami and fights evil spirits, Kubo submitted a manuscript of Bleach to Weekly Shonen Jump shortly after Zombie Powder ended hoping that it would be published; the story was rejected, since the editors claimed it was too similar to Togashi Yoshihiro s YuYu Hakusho. Toriyama Akira, the creator of Dragon Ball, saw the story and sent a letter of encouragement to Kubo which inspired him to continue working on Bleach. The serialization began running in the same magazine in 2001, and an anime adaptation began running in Japan in 2004. The manga was named a winner of the Shogakukan Manga Award for its category in 2005."

While he was in high school, he made his debut with Nikyu Tenshi in Manga Sh nen (1954). Like most of the Japanese artists, Ishimori was influenced by Tezuka Osamu. In 1956, he formed a coterie group with Akatsuka Fujio, Nagashima Shinji and Suzuki Mitsuaki. He moved to Tokyo after graduation, where he continued to work as a mangaka, starting with the war story Kaiketsu Harimao in 1959. Subsequently, he produced hit mangas such as the science fiction series Cyborg 009 (1964) and the historical series Sabu to Ichi Torimono Hikae (Big Comic, 1968-72). In the 1970s, Ishimori created metamorphosis manga such as Kamen Rider and in the 1980s, he became a pioneer of a new manga category. In 1989, he commenced working on a large series about the history of Japan, Manga Nihon no Rekishi, which remained unfinished due to the artist's death on January 28th, 1998 at the age of 60.  Ishinomori was nicknamed the 'King of Manga' and is considered one of the pioneers of modern manga. He was also one of the most productive creators, producing over 120,000 pages of artwork in thirty years. It's rumored that he drew over 500 pages in one month!"

Tada made her debut in 1977, when still a high-school student, in Shueisha's """"Deluxe Margaret"""" magazine. Tada's stories belong to the shoujo genre of manga and feature love stories centered around young female characters and their love interests. The storylines include comedic moments and are characterised by essential and sharp drawings. Some of Tada's most popular works are Aishite Knight, Itazura na Kiss and Kimi no Na wa Deborah.  Aishite Knight portrays the Japanese rock music scene of the early 1980s. The anime series based on Ai Shite Knight was the first ever to feature original songs performed within the episodes. Another of Tada's works, Miha Paradise is also set in the rock 'n' roll world.  Itazura na Kiss (Mischievous Kiss) - begun in 1991 and never completed - was by far Tada's most successful work in Japan. It tells the love story between Kotoko and Naoki from high school until after their marriage. The series inspired also an illustrated art book """"Itazura na Kiss Illustration Shuu"""" and two novels written by Nori Harata and published in Shueisha's """"Cobalt"""" series. In 1996 a live-action Japanese TV series based on Itazura na Kiss was also produced, starring Aiko Satoo as Kotoko and Takashi Kashiwabara as Naoki. In 2005, the series was adapted into a Taiwanese drama under the name of It Started With a Kiss.  Kaoru Tada died on 11 March 1999, aged only 38, following a domestic accident that occurred while she was moving to a new house with her husband and son."

In July 2011, he revealed on Media Factory's website that he had advanced stage cancer that was discovered in February of that year and which was untreatable at the time, which affected his work on the final two volumes of Zero no Tsukaima. After an unrelated gallstone surgery, the cancerous growth was found to have shrunk allowing surgery to take place in early August 2011.He was later readmitted into the hospital in December 2011, and had another surgery in November 2012.

While in college, he developed an interest in manga, which led him to create his own complete work, [Black Magic](https://mangadex.org/title/e8b3afad-96d5-48d0-9be4-5760d4672c45/black-magic), which was published in the manga fanzine Atlas. His work caught the eye of Seishinsha President Harumichi Aoki, who offered to publish him. The result was [Appleseed](https://mangadex.org/title/2d68c7b8-6085-49cb-9c44-ec16805481da/appleseed), a full volume of densely-plotted drama taking place in an ambiguous future. The story was a sensation and won the 1986 Seiun Award for Best Manga. After a professional reprint of Black Magic and a second volume of Appleseed, he released [Dominion](https://mangadex.org/title/0f623742-d82c-472f-bda4-d6e3f1039b7c/dominion) in 1986. Two more volumes of Appleseed followed before he began work on his best-known work [Ghost in the Shell](https://mangadex.org/title/c4994dc6-f2ee-4eb7-a00c-ebca63b35268/the-ghost-in-the-shell). Won the Seiun Award for Best Art in 1992.  Presently publishes hentai artboks like Greaseberries, Pieces and W-Tails under his own name."

Their real names are Hiroshi Fujimoto (    , Fujimoto Hiroshi, 1933 1996) and Motoo Abiko (      , Abiko Motoo, 1934-2022). They formed their partnership in 1951, and used the Fujiko Fujio name from 1954 until dissolution of the partnership in 1987.  From the outset they adopted a collaborative style where both worked simultaneously on the story and artwork, but as they diverged creatively they started releasing individual works under different names, Abiko as Fujiko Fujio   (      , Fujiko Fujio  , credited as Fujiko A. Fujio outside Japan), and Fujimoto as [Fujiko F. Fujio](https://mangadex.org/author/42d595b6-d361-4f55-a04d-2010950d6d66/fujiko-f-fujio) (   F    , Fujiko Efu Fujio).
